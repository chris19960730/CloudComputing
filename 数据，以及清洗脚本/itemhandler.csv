Gresley. It was employed on long-distance express trains on the LNER and its successors, British Railways Eastern and North-Eastern Regions, notably on the 10am London to Edinburgh Flying Scotsman service after which it was named. In its career 4472 Flying Scotsman has covered more than 2,000,000 miles (3,200,000 km).Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout.

Plastic model kit. Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches.

Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960's.

It was the smallest of the 'Big Four' railway regions with most of it's revenue coming from passenger traffic rather than freight in the more densely populated region of southern England. A number of famous 'named' trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle, Bournemouth Belle, Golden Arrow, the Night Ferry (London - Paris and Brussels), Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923. The electrification of the region began in 1929 under the management of Sir Herbert Walker. On completion it was the world's largest electrified railway system. Southern Railway gave the designation 2-BIL to the DC third rail electric multiple units built during the 1930s. The formation was a 2-car set: MBTL-DTCL, and were called 2-BIL (2-car Bi-Lavatory stock) because each set had two lavatories, one in each car. They were built to work long distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London to Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Reading. Between 1935 and 1938, a total of 152 sets of the Class 2-BIL were built in 4 batches and were numbered 2001-2152. Numbers 2001-2010 in 1935 for service on the London to Eastbourne sector.

dc598f016a3664f70ca65a87022a18a6,Hornby R3060 RailRoad BR 'Tornado' Class A1 00 Gauge Steam Locomotive,Hornby,79.95,7,4.4 out of 5 stars, Locomotives,"Product Description 60163 Tornado is a main-line steam locomotive built in Darlington, England. Completed in 2008, Tornado was the first such locomotive built in the United Kingdom since Evening Star, the last steam locomotive built by British Railways, in 1960. Designed to meet modern safety and certification standards, Tornado runs on the UK rail network and on mainline-connected heritage railways.The locomotive was built by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, a charitable trust founded in 1990 to build Tornado and possibly further locomotives. Tornado was conceived as an evolution of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 class, incorporating improvements likely had steam continued, and changes for cost, safety, manufacturing and operational benefits, while replicating the original design's sound and appearance. Tornado, completely new-built, is considered the 50th Peppercorn A1, numbered next in the class after 60162, Saint Johnstoun, built in 1949.Tornado moved under her own power for the first time on 29 July 2008 at Darlington, and then spent two months at the preserved Great Central Railway double-track tourist railway in Loughborough, where she was tested up to 60 mph (97 km/h) and operated her first passenger train. Tornado then moved to the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York for three test runs on the main line up to 75 mph (121 km/h). After repainting into LNER Apple Green, Tornado was approved for main-line passenger operation. On 31 January 2009 she hauled her first passenger trip on the main line, The Peppercorn Pioneer, from York to Newcastle and back. By hauling various A1 Trust railtours, charters and other activities, Tornado will begin to recoup the estimated ?800,000 debt from the project, which cost around ?3 million.The new Hornby model is represented in the familiar Apple Green of the early British Railways colour scheme.Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriatate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout. This loco is 'DCC Ready', meaning they feature a special socket ready to receive a DCC Decoder. To convert this locomotive for use on a DCC layout one of the following digital decoder chips are required; R8245 Sapphire Decoder or R8249 V1 3 NMRA Loco Decoder. Once this decoder is fitted it is ready to use on a DCC layout.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallard?s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike the Mallard?s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s, Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the ?A4 Preservation Society?, later known as ?The A4 Locomotive Society Ltd? and now ?The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd?. ?The A4 Locomotive Society? has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust.

Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game (with optional rules for four-player tag-team play) based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or ""Lucha Libre"" (a.k.a. free fighting). Players start with 21 points of health (or 18 in a tag-team match) and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a ""count of three"" to win by a pin. The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice. Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die. Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc. Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit. If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent. Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled. If PIN comes up, the 'three count' begins. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using their wrestling dice or lose the match. In a tag-team match players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them..., if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.

But despite its size, this game certainly is substantial! There are 9 special alphabet dice, featuring letters on their faces and score values depending on how usuable they are. The aim of the games is to build the highest-scoring word you can. The key to this game is that the contents of the entire set are listed on what is called The Dice Table, each die being identifiable by a unique colour (and a special character for the colour blind). The Dice Table enables you to assess the chance of achieving particular letters when rerolling, making for a compelling game of luck, skill and judgement. And the Dicewords set offers over 10 million combinations, so it's a different game every time. ) An ideal game for travel and summer holidays, easy to pop into a pocket or handbag and an excellent game for Christmas and those long winter nights.

Set Up Each player takes either the red or black set of sixteen dice and prepares to set up at opposite ends of the board. Players then simultaneously roll each of their sixteen dice, one at a time. Once rolled, each die is placed immediately on the board. This commences of the left square on a player?s back row and continues across to the right. On completion of the back row, the dice are placed from the left again on the next row up. After each roll, each die must be placed onto the next available square. Players cannot select on which square they would like to place each die. Once both players have completed the set up, play commences. Rules The player with the most sixes starts (if the players have the same amount, then the player with the most fives starts and so on). Players take one turn each alternately. A player can move any one die the number of squares that corresponds to the number showing on that die. . For example, if that number is a 3, the player can move that die forwards, backwards, sideways or diagonally up or down in a straight line over three squares. Within the movement the die cannot pass over any other die (either an opponent??s die or their own). If any move results in a die landing on a square occupied by an opponent??s die then the opponent??s die is ??taken?? and removed from the board. Instead of moving a die on any turn a player can opt to rotate one of their dice 90 degrees. For example a die with a 3 showing can be turned over to a 1,2,5 or 6 whilst remaining on its current square. This movement constitutes a player??s turn.

It was a two-seat grand touring car with instruments housed in the steering wheel, a push-button transmission, exterior microphones to pick up and transmit traffic sounds, and a host of other innovative devices. It was a 'rolling laboratory' from which Ford would learn about new technology to apply to their production automobiles. The car was built entirely by hand in Turin, Italy and, like many concept cars, was never put into production. In the mid 1960's, George Barris of Barris Kustom City acquired the car directly from Ford.The story goes that he was approached by producers from Fox who were going to be doing a BATMAN TV Series and needed an exotic car. George sketched out a version of the Futura with suitable ""Bat"" alterations and presented it to the producers. George felt it was the perfect answer, considering the bat-like qualities his Futura already had and the fact that the car had to be ready for action in a mere three weeks.

It will reach 60 mph in just 2.9 seconds, and will go on to achieve a top speed of 217 mph.

Of course, the doors, bonnet and boot all open; the rear wing is moveable, the exhaust is chrome plated, and all the intricate metal grills are photo etched.

Gyros in RC helicopters are most commonly used to control unwanted movement on the yaw axis. When an RC helicopter rotates on its yaw axis, the direction the nose points (the heading) changes. The yaw gyro's job is to sense any undesired rotation around the yaw axis (clockwise or counter clockwise rotation when viewed from above), and to automatically correct the orientation of the RC helicopter. Without a yaw gyro, even if the RC helicopter was trimmed out to fly straight initially, it would eventually begin to drift and rotate right or left. Normal maneuvering of the RC helicopter and external forces can result in undesired yaw rotation. When this occurs, the gyroscope senses this change in yaw and corrects it. This results in stable flight for the RC helicopter and no undesired changes in yaw. SPECIFICATION Colour May Vary.

The brilliant new Parrot Bebop Drone 2 additionally incorporates a new 2700mAh battery, cleverly built into the streamlined body, that provides a continuous flight time of up to 25 minutes, more than doubling the previous duration.The new Parrot Bebop 2 weighs a little more than it's predecessor at around 500 grams, but is still remarkably lightweight for a leisure Drone with a professional specification. Capable of improved performance, incorporating four powerful brushless motors fitted with slightly larger propellers to provide additional thrust, the Bebop 2 can climb vertically upwards at 13 mph and fly forward faster at up to 37 mph, allowing the Drone to cope with headwinds better.Controlled using a Smartphone or Tablet with a Wi-Fi range of 300 metres, the Bebop Drone 2 can also be piloted using the exclusive new black Parrot Special Edition Skycontroller, if you prefer. Providing a more precise response by using its two conventional control sticks, the piloting device is fixed on a shelf that will accommodate the vast majority of Smartphones and Tablets available on the market. The Skycontroller can operate the Bebop 2 with or without a Tablet, and extends the Wi-Fi range up to 2 kilometres (1.2 miles), subject to local regulations.Furthermore, for extreme sensations you can connect a virtual reality headset to your Skycontroller, provided it's HDMI compatible, to give you a 'First Person View' from the Drone?s camera, as seen from the cockpit. The pilot can still use the Skycontroller to adjust the position of the camera, independent from the Drones movements. The combination of numerous sensors provides impressive stability, plus great manoeuvrability when flown with the Skycontroller, a Smartphone or Tablet.Designed with safety in mind, the Parrot Bebop Drone 2's lightweight reinforced structure makes it robust and safe. In case of accidental contact, all four propellers stop automatically, additionally an Emergency Mode enables you to land the drone immediately, whilst a GPS Return Home function brings the Drone back to its take off point easily.

On the Welcome Screen, the pilot can easily access the following functions: Piloting, Photos/Videos, Flight Plan and the Pilot Academy. Simply complete the user settings for Altitude, Speed, Piloting Mode, Accelerometer and Virtual Joystick. The FreeFlight app also includes fun features such as a One Touch Flip!Plan your flights on your Smartphone or Tablet by touching waypoints on your screen, and let the Drone do the rest.

This version features a 3rd axis on the Zenmuse gimbal for incredibly smooth footage from your GoPro. The gimbal counter-acts movements on the quadcopters yaw axis making this the best solution for aerial footage from your GoPro. The Phantom 2 is an evolution of the Phantom. It features the same compact and highly integrated design, but comes with FPV flying and Aerial Photography support right out of the box. Hardware mountings and software tuning are all carried out prior to delivery, meaning with rotors attached, a charged battery and transmitter batteries available it can fly immediately. Additional features include a higher payload, a built-in intelligent battery, H3-3D gimbal support and other functions. The 3-axis Zenmuse H3-3D Gimbal is another milestone in gimbal innovation. Designed for the GoPro Hero3 and Hero3+, it is a high precision gimbal offering high stability, light weight and plug and play simplicity. It is ideal for a range of applications, from film and TV to cinematography. Precise Flight & Ground Station Support Precision flight and stable hovering is provided by the integrated GPS auto-pilot system that offers position holding, altitude lock and stable hovering, giving you constant smooth flight so you can focus on getting the shots you want. The Ground station support allows the user to program a flight path using your smartphone with our 16 waypoint Ground Station system. This means that as the Phantom 2 with H3-3D Gimbal flies autonomously you are able to tilt the camera up and down, take photos and shoot video all the while without having to worry about flying the drone. Quadcopter & 2 Computer Modes The Phantom 2 flight control system has two computer-assisted flight modes for you to choose from. If the Quadcopter loses the signal from the controller for any reason the ""return to home"" feature will initialize. IOC is designed to help make flying more intuitive. The remote control operates with 4 AA Batteries and when fully charged the Phantom 2 Vision + will provide a flight time of 25 minutes. Easy Battery ReplacementView larger Intelligent, Long Lasting Battery The high capacity, high performance 5200mAh Lithium Polymer battery offers up to 25 minutes of flight time. It provides battery capacity data, over charge/discharge protection, as well as maintenance reminders making the battery extremely safe and reliable. Flight time from a full charge is 25 minutes.

Building the stunning replica of Hogwarts Castle was challenging and exciting and resulted in several hours of silence and unprecedented concentration. The stunning, unexpected details were impressive: trap doors, secret stairways, moving portraits, treasure chests, a working magnifying glass, an impressive holographic sticker, a glow-in-the-dark Voldemort and a Hagrid who, in comparison to the other figures, was a perfectly proportioned giant. The basic instructions were easy to follow and the castle can be built in many different ways, allowing children to use their imaginations and recreate scenes from the books. This is a sure-fire winner for any Harry Potter fan, and indeed for any LEGO fan. The Gryffindor Dormitory set and the Chamber of the Winged Keys are less difficult to build and would make great presents, particularly for younger Harry Potter fans, but when combined with the Hogwarts Castle set they add new dimensions to the scene.

Despite the proved success of the A3s, Gresley and his engineers needed to take the next step to become quicker and more efficient. Whilst looking at ways to progress he travelled to Germany and America looking at their evolvement but because of size restrictions on the British railway network he discovered that their larger locomotives were not an option. It was then that chief designer Sir Nigel Gresley looked into aerodynamics, thus creating the ?Silver Jubilee? streamlined trains which were inspired by a Bugatti rail-car that he observed on a trip to France. After wind tunnel tests it was also discovered that not only could they achieve greater speeds whilst using less energy, the design also meant that an updraft off the locomotive pushed the steam upwards giving the driver improved driving vision. Over a three year period between 1935 and 1938 there were a total of thirty five A4s built at the LNER's Doncaster works. The first four A4s all had the word 'Silver' in the title, this was in relation to the King George V Silver Jubilee, five were named after Commonwealth countries but with Gresley being a keen bird watcher, the majority were named after fast flying birds. Arguably the most famous of all the class is the Mallard, carrying the distinctive streamline casing in Garter Blue, the appearance of this A4 depicts the 1930s real captivation with speed and luxury. The Mallard was the locomotive chosen to attempt breaking the world speed record, onon the 3rd July 1938 heading south at Stoke Bank near Grantham, the Mallard broke the record measuring 125.88mph. To this day it still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world. The Mallard is now part of the National Railway Collection on static display at Shildon.

The German manufactured vehicle was known as the VW Transporter or VW Caravelle (T3) in Europe, whilst in the UK it went under the VW T25 title. Assembled in Hanover, it had a production life from 1979 to 1992 - and until 2002 in South Africa, when it was superseded by the VW Transporter (T4).

Its founder, Thomas Wynn was originally employed on the railways, but soon saw a need for an improved ""onward distribution"" system after goods were unloaded from the trains. Using a fleet of horses and carts, he transported goods that were delivered directly to Newport by rail and soon formed an association with a local flourmill, delivering flour to bakeries and shops in the local valleys. An association that carried on until well into the 1950s, when the mill had to close. After the death of Thomas Wynn in 1878, his 15 year-old son, Robert Wynn (who later gave his name to the company) took over the business with the help of his eldest sister, Emma. The business continued to grow and Robert saw the possibilities for heavy haulage as the steel works in Newport were developed. In 1890 he built a boiler wagon capable of carrying 40 tons of heavy machinery with the propulsion still provided by up to 48 horses.

The first release on the newly tooled Humber Pullman was - in real life - owned by Baroness Rothschild. It is now in the Humber Car Museum owned by Allan Marshall, who allowed the Oxford team to research the intricate internal and external detail to produce the master model. Our newly tooled Humber Pullman is a superb miniature. Starting with the exterior, the back and burgundy two-tone paintwork is offset by a wealth of silver chrome effect masking from the radiator, headlights, door handles and rear light clusters to the authentic replica of the Pullman badge. The Humber badge is masked in red out of silver and the Rothschild crest adorns the front doors. We love the whitewall tyres, which complement the contrasting burgundy wheel inserts. Inside, the detail is even more amazing. In the front, the dashboard top and the steering wheel are reproduced in 'sunshine' beige with a detailed dashboard and door cappings in brown. The floor/carpets and front seats are a rich burgundy colour. Behind the interior dividing screen, which separated the chauffeur from the rear passenger area, the colour scheme is a rich cream used for the seats, floor/carpets and the door panels, with the door cappings finished in brown.","Technical Details Item Weight136 g Product Dimensions12.5 x 4.3 x 4.1 cm Manufacturer recommended age:14 years and up Manufacturer referenceHPL001 Scale1:43 Track Width/GaugeO Material Type(s)Metal ??

It was known for its unconventional turretless design, with a fixed gun traversed by engaging the tracks and elevated by adjusting the hull suspension. Turretless armoured fighting vehicles are usually classified as assault guns or tank destroyers, but the Strv 103 is considered a tank because of its gun laying ability and its designated combat role matches those of other tanks. It is the only main battle tank and the only tank of any kind since the World War II era to dispense with a turret. The Strv 103 was designed and manufactured in Sweden. It was developed in the 1950s and was the first main battle tank to use a turbine engine. The result was a very low-profile design with an emphasis on defence and heightened crew protection level. Strv 103s formed a major portion of the Swedish armoured forces from the 1960s to part of the 1990s, but have since been removed from service in favour of the Stridsvagn 122.

The 38(t) was designed and entered production for the Czechoslovak Army as the LT vz. 38, however before any could be delivered Germany occupied then divided the country. They rated the tank highly, ordering continued production of the initial lot of 150, renaming it the 38(t) with (t) denoting its Czech origin. It went on to serve as the front-line tank for the Wehrmacht in early WWII, from the initial operations in Poland up to and including Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. It wielded a 37mm gun with 90 rounds on board, a coaxial 7.92mm MG37(t) machine gun, and another MG37 on the front left of the vehicle. 42km/h was squeezed out of the 6-cylinder engine. Ausf.E/F 38(t) variants featured doubled front armor thickness at 50mm, with 30mm on the hull and turret sides. 525 were produced in the period from November 1940 to October 1941."

The AS-90 was first deployed by the British Army in 1993.[1] 179 AS-90s were acquired to re-equip six of the eight self-propelled field artillery regiments (each 24 guns) in the 1 (BR) Corps, replacing the 105 mm FV433 Abbot SPG and older M109 155 mm Self Propelled Gun.

AS-90 was designed and built by the Armaments division of Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL), whose parent company became BAE Systems in 1999. VSEL provided 179 vehicles between 1992 and 1995 at a cost of 300 million ($480 million USD). The AS-90 underwent a capability enhancement program in 2008 and 2009, primarily relating to upgrades of the AS-90's electronic system.
